# uct.py
Python module for parsing and working with UCT-DEF grid models. Contains classes for grid elements:
* **Node** (##N)
* **Line** (##L)
* **Transformer** (##T)
* **Regulation** (##R)
* **Parameter** (##TT)
* **Schedule** (##E)

Additional classes:
* **Grid** - main class to contain the whole grid
* **Area** - groups elements by their area defined by node area or node they connect to.  
* **Element** - basic class with methods common for all types of grid elements

## Initialization
To use the module import it to your script. The best way is to import just the ***Grid*** class:
```
from uct import Grid
```

To expose all classes, functions and variables in the module use:
```
from uct import *
```
*Note*: To import the module in form of ***uct.py*** file it has to be located in a folder included in the python's [sys.path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html).\
If your folder is not included, append the `sys.path` and then import the module:
```
import sys
sys.path.append(r"c:\My_Folder_With_Uct_Module")
from uct import Grid
```
To load uct model from a ****.uct*** file set a variable to a Grid class with a file path as an attribute:
```
model_object = Grid(r"c:\Folder_With_Uct_Files\Uct_file.uct")
```
If you want to check your grid, print the instance of the ***Grid*** object which will return number of loaded grid elements:
```
>>> print(model_object)
Grid(Nodes: 19600; Lines: 23868; Transformers: 3993; Regulations: 2845; Parameters: 2; Schedules: 3)
```

## Classes
### 📚 `Grid(uct_file_path)`
The main class that contains all grid elements read from the uct file.\
*uct_file_path* has to conform to the UCT naming or else an exception is raised.
#### Attributes: 
▶ `Grid.file -> str` - uct file path passed during class initialization is stored here.\
▶ `Grid.filename -> Sub` - object containing parsed uct file name parts as attributes (accepts only formats/values):
* `.year -> str` - year of the scenario (YYYY)
* `.month -> str`-  month of the scenario (MM)
* `.day -> str` - day of the scenario (DD)
* `.hour -> str` - hour of the scenario (HH)
* `.minute -> str` - minute of the scenario (MM)
* `.type -> str` - uct process type (FO, SN, RE, LR, 00 - 24)
* `.week_day -> str` - week day index (1 - 7)
* `.area -> str` - area code from uct filename (keys of `countries` dictionary)
* `.version -> str` - uct file version (0 - 9)
example:
```
>>> model_object = Grid(r"c:\Folder_With_Uct_Files\Uct_file.uct")
>>> model_object.filename
Sub(area='UX', day='06', hour='06', minute='30', month='02', type='FO', version='2', week_day='1', year='2019')
>>> model_object.filename.year
'2023'
```
▶ `Grid.uct_text_original -> str` - text of the uct file as a whole without any changes.\
▶ `Grid.uct_version -> str` - uct format version identification ( ❕ not file version ❕ )\
▶ `Grid.comments -> list` - list of all comment blocks from uct file. If uct file contain multiple comment blocks directives (##C), list will contain multiple items.\
▶ `Grid.areas -> dict` - dictionary of [Area](#-areaarea_code-str-grid_instance-grid) type objects with area code as key.
```
>>> md.areas
{'ME': Area(ME, Nodes: 52, Lines: 75, Transformers: 12, NP: 224.4877),
'AL': Area(AL, Nodes: 160, Lines: 192, Transformers: 29, NP: 270.2495), ... }
```
▶ `Grid.not_read -> dict` - dictionary of lines from uct file that were note recognized during parsing. Keys are object names corresponding to the element blocks (*Node, Line, Transformer, Regulation, Parameter, Schedule*). Values are lists of strings (text lines from the file). If everything was read correctly, the dictionary is empty. Only keys of not read elements are present.
```
>>> model_object.not_read.keys()
dict_keys(['Node', 'Line', 'Regulation', 'Transformer', 'Parameter', 'Schedule'])
```
▶ `Grid.nodes -> dict` - dictionary of [Node](#📚-node) type objects organized as *Node.id: Node*.\
▶ `Grid.lines -> dict` - dictionary of [Line](#📚-line) type objects organized as *Line.id: Line*.\
▶ `Grid.transformers -> dict` - dictionary of [Transformer](#📚-transformer) type objects organized as *Transformer.id: Transformer*.\

### 📚 `Area(area_code: str, grid_instance: Grid)`

### 📚 `Node()`

### 📚 `Line()`

### 📚 `Transformer()`

### 📚 `Sub(**kwargs)` :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
Helper class to create an arbitrary object based on passed keyword arguments.

Example:
```
>> object = Sub(name = "John", surname = "Wick")
>>> object
Sub(name='John', surname='Wick')
>>> object.name
'John'
>>> object.surname
'Wick'
```
